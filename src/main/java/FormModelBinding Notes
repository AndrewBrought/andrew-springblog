Ad Controller:

@GetMApping("/ads/create")
public String showCreateForm(Model model) {
// We have to send an ad object to our form in the view
model.addAttribute("ad", new Ad());
return "ads/create_ad";
}

What ever method we have that is like an edit form or create form, we need to make sure we send an empty
reference object


Create View
                                      //Here we're telling our form that we're referencing this empty
                                      ad object
<form action="/ads/create" method="post" th:object="${ad}">
Title:
// These represent the properties of that object...called selection expressions
<input th:field="*{title}" />
Description:
<input th:field="*{description}" />
<br />
<input type="submit" />
</form>

**Look up Thymeleaf form model binding for checkboxes

Ad Controller: Post Mapping

@PostMapping("/ads/create")
// We have to ref. the ModAtt
// Links up the form object to our controller so we can save it!
public String create(@ModelAttribute Ad ad) {
adsDao.save(ad);
return "redirect:/ads/view";
}
